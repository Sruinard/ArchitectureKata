- **Service** initiative deployed by a non-profit to help candidates overcome a particular challenge
- **Candidate** A member of an under-represented demographic that, consumer of non-profit offerings that is deliverd via the platform
- **Platform** An online system provided by the [Diversity Cyber Counsil](https://www.diversitycybercouncil.com/) both aimed at: helping, connecting and furthering candidates in their carreer in the tech industry, as well as support inter non-profit collaboration and sharing to fill in the gaps of service and overall impact.

## Persona's

- **Non-profit (the facilitator)** Kobe, 42, grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. He has witnessed first hand how difficult it can be to break away from stigmas and get a better life. Since 5 years he has been investing his time in helping people from underrepresented backgrounds to land their dream job. One of the things he loves working on is providing teenagers a connected experience. An experience in which they feel supported and empowered. Jonathon is good add coaching and seeing how small pieces of the puzzle fit together.

- **Candidate (the lifelong-learner)** Janine, 28, works 2 jobs at a supermarket and local restaurant, has the smarts and is eager to 'get out' bus doesn't know how. She has an interest in technology and would love to have a career at a tech company, but does not have the right education for it and therefore was not able to land a job in tech. She works long hours and doesn't make enough money to afford expensive training during working hours.
She believes that given a chance for an interview, she'll be able to convince the company that she'll be of great value and is willing to learn anything to prove that.

## Defining the system boundaries
We'll be leveraging a context diagram to create a simplified representation of our system which is understandable for a wide audience (i.e. technical and non-technical stakeholders). At first, we focus on the stakeholders we try to empower and leave the operational part out of scope (i.e. admin user). The context diagram as depicted in Figure 1:
